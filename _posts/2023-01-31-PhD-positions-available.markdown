We have two open PhD positions in the planet formation group at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/)!

This research is funded by the ERC Advanced grant [DUSTSPEC]({% post_url 2022-04-26-ERC-funding %}), which aims to make progress in our understanding of the first steps in building planets. Planets are formed in discs of gas and dust around young stars. We will build computer models of how small dust particles interact with the gas, and how that can help clumping these particles together to form bigger solid objects. We will develop techniques involving Machine Learning to speed up calculations, and try and determine the maximum possible solid planets that can be built this way.
