Very pleased to announce the ERC Advanced Grant DUSTSPEC: "Sizes Matter: the Dust Size Distribution during Planet Formation". This grant of â‚¬ 2,3 million will fund research into the evolution of solids in protoplanetary discs. Specifically, we will look at the size distribution of solid particles: at any given time, how many micron-sized dust specks, how many cm-sized pebbles, m-sized boulders, and eventually planet-sized planets exist in the disc?

In the cartoon above, a typical power law size distribution is sketched by the blue line. Since different sized particles emit/reflect at different wavelengths, we can probe various sizes by observing at different wavelengths. On the left is an observation of CQ Tau ([Uyama et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159..118U/abstract), [Benisty et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220309991B/abstract)) in scattered light, probing the smallest particles. In the middle we see an ALMA observation of HD 163296 ([Andrews et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...869L..41A/abstract)) at mm wavelengths, sensitive to thermal emission of roughly mm-sized particles. On the right, the radial velocity observation of Proxima b [(Anglada-Escude et al. (2016))](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016Natur.536..437A/abstract).

We know of at least one case where the dust size distribution plays a critical role in determining the local *dynamics* of protoplanetary discs: the Streaming Instability in an unstratified shearing box. This was studied in [Krapp et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...878L..30K/abstract), [Paardekooper et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.4223P/abstract), and [McNally et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.1469M/abstract). The last paper found that there are quite strong constraints on the dust size distribution for the streaming instability to operate at all. Interestingly, this points at a possible relation between observed activity and the size distribution, and it is this relation we are going to explore over the next 5 years.

Stay tuned for job opportunities!
