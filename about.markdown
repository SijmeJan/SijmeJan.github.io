This website is dedicated to the research we do on planet formation in the  the [Astrodynamics and Space Missions group](https://www.tudelft.nl/index.php?id=6959) at the [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/). In particular, my group focuses on the evolution of solids in protoplanetary discs, from micron-sized dust particles all the way up to full-sized planets.

Planets form in discs of gas and dust around young stars. Within these disc, solid particles have to grow 14 orders of magnitude in size to become a terrestrial or even gas giant planet. This road is full up potential pitfalls: disruptive collisions, radial drift, planet migration, to name a few. We employ numerical simulations, in particular numerical hydrodynamics, to study in detail how the various growth stages may proceed.

This research is made possible by the [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/) though an [Advanced Grant](https://erc.europa.eu/news/erc-2021-advanced-grants-results). This project, DUSTSPEC, revolves around the question how the *dust size distribution* evolves and even governs the dynamical processes that will eventually result in planets. We will also look into what can be learned from ALMA images.
